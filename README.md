A .NET port of my old vstool ruby command-line helper.

Lots of TODO's

 * Check for running objects
 * add 'connect to process' support
 * add 'breakpoint setting' support
 * Make sure 'wait' mode doesn't hang
 * This was originally going to be a powershell DLL - now its a
   commandline program, maybe that will change.
