A .NET port of my old [vstool ruby](https://github.com/whitty/vstool/) command-line helper.

Lots of TODO's

 * Check for [running objects](https://github.com/whitty/win32olerot/)
   to avoid duplicate sessions
 * add 'connect to process' support
   --engine
 * add 'breakpoint setting' support
 * add project build
   --configuration
 * set configuration
 * Make sure 'wait' mode doesn't hang
 * Add restart to failure

This was originally going to be a powershell DLL - now its a
command-line program, maybe that will change again.
